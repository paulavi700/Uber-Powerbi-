## 📊 Project Overview

This dashboard analyzes thousands of Uber trips to help understand:
- When and where rides are most in demand
- How surge pricing correlates with peak hours
- Which vehicle types and payment methods dominate
- Revenue distribution across pickup/drop-off zones

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Structure

The project uses two relational tables connected via `LocationID`.

### 🚕 Trip Details Table
Contains granular information about each individual Uber ride.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `Trip ID` | Unique identifier for each trip |
| `Pickup Time` | Date & time passenger was picked up |
| `Drop Off Time` | Date & time passenger was dropped off |
| `Passenger Count` | Number of passengers in the trip |
| `Trip Distance` | Distance covered (in miles) |
| `PULocationID` | Numeric code for pickup location |
| `DOLocationID` | Numeric code for drop-off location |
| `Payment Type` | Mode of payment (credit card, cash, wallet) |
| `Fare Amount` | Base fare before additional fees |
| `Surge Fee` | Extra charge applied during high-demand periods |
| `Vehicle` | Uber service type (UberX, UberXL, Uber Black) |

### 📍 Location Table
Maps numeric LocationIDs to real area names and cities.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `LocationID` | Unique identifier — key to link with trip data |
| `Location` | Area or neighborhood name |
| `City` | City where the location exists |

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Surge pricing** spikes strongly align with late-night and early-morning demand windows
- **UberX** dominates overall ride share, while **UberXL** records higher average passenger counts
- Specific **pickup zones** consistently generate disproportionately high revenue
- **Credit card** remains the most preferred payment method across cities
- Trip duration and distance patterns reveal clear **short-trip vs long-trip** corridors

## 📐 Data Model

```
Trip Details Table
    |
    |--- PULocationID ──→ Location Table (LocationID)
    |--- DOLocationID ──→ Location Table (LocationID)
```

Star schema design with the Location Table acting as a shared dimension for both pickup and drop-off analysis.
